# Meal Diary, our final project for \</Salt\>

For our final project of the \</Salt\> bootcamp we created a meal tracker.

## Demonstration

For a demonstration, your can visit http://mealdiary.herokuapp.com or take a look at these demo-gifs

A user can sign up for Meal Diary with their e-mail, password, name, weight, height and daily calorie goal.
After that they can log in to their account, which is the dashboard with their user info and sections to enter breakfast, lunch or dinner items.
As you can see here, items can be added for each day as the top bar is a calendar.

Users can insert their food items for each day and adjust their weight whenever they want. All information is then used to make graphs for calorie intake, weight and macro intake over time
